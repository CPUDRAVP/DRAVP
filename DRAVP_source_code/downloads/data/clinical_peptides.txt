Upon administration, brilacidin selectively destabilizes bacterial and viral membrane integrity, which leads to their proteolysis and degradation. HDPs are part of the innate immune response and act as the first line of defense against foreign pathogens. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been shown to suppress defensins."	DRAVP01564.png
